### III

*Over large historical periods, the entire mode of existence of human collectives changes, as does the manner of their sensory perception.* The way in which human sensory perception is organized—the medium through which it occurs—is not only naturally but also historically conditioned. The era of the Migration Period, during which late Roman industrial art and the Vienna Genesis emerged, had not only a different art than antiquity but also a different mode of perception. The scholars of the Vienna School, Riegl and Wickhoff, who opposed the weight of classical tradition under which that art had been buried, were the first to conceive the idea of drawing conclusions about the organization of perception in the time in which it was valid from that art. As far-reaching as their insights were, they were limited by the fact that these researchers confined themselves to identifying the formal signature peculiar to perception in late Roman times. They did not attempt—nor perhaps could they hope—to show the social upheavals expressed in these changes in perception. For the present, the conditions for such insight are more favorable. And if changes in the medium of perception, of which we are contemporaries, can be understood as a decline of aura, then one can identify its social conditions.
It is advisable to illustrate the concept of aura proposed above for historical objects with the concept of an aura from natural objects. We define this latter as the unique appearance of a distance, no matter how close it may be. Resting on a summer afternoon while following a mountain range on the horizon or a branch casting its shadow over someone resting—that means breathing in the aura of these mountains or this branch. Based on this description, it is easy to understand the social conditions underlying the contemporary decline of aura. It is based on two circumstances, both related to the increasing significance of masses in today’s life. Namely: *Bringing things “closer” spatially and humanly is just as passionate a concern for today’s masses[^1] as is their tendency to overcome the uniqueness of every given thing through its reproduction.* Day by day, there is an increasing need to grasp an object at close range in its image—or rather its reproduction.

And unmistakably, reproduction—as provided by illustrated magazines and newsreels—differs from an image. Uniqueness and permanence are as tightly interwoven in an image as transience and repeatability are in reproduction. The removal of an object from its shell, the destruction of its aura, is a hallmark of a perception whose “sense for sameness in the world” has grown so much that it extracts sameness even from what is unique through reproduction. In the realm of visual experience, this manifests what appears in theory as the growing importance of statistics. The alignment of reality toward masses and masses toward reality is a process with unlimited implications for both thought and perception.



[^1]: Allowing oneself to become closer to the masses in a human way can mean removing one’s social function from view. There is no guarantee that a contemporary portraitist, painting a famous surgeon at the breakfast table and among his family, captures his social function more accurately than a painter of the sixteenth century who presents his doctors in a representative manner, such as Rembrandt does in *The Anatomy Lesson,* to the public.
