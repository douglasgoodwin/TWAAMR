The reception of works of art occurs with different emphases, among which two polar opposites stand out. One of these emphases lies on the cult value, the other on the exhibition value of the artwork.[^1],[^2] Artistic production begins with creations that serve the purposes of cults. For these creations, it is more important that they exist than that they are seen, as one might assume. The animal painted by Stone Age humans on the walls of their caves is a magical instrument. While it is displayed to their fellow humans, it is primarily intended for spirits. Cult value as such seems to insist on keeping the artwork hidden: certain statues of gods are accessible only to priests in the *cella*, certain Madonna images remain covered almost all year long, and certain sculptures on medieval cathedrals are not visible to viewers standing at ground level.

With the emancipation of individual art practices from the womb of ritual, opportunities for exhibiting their products increase. The exhibition potential of a portrait bust, which can be transported from one place to another, is greater than that of a statue of a god fixed in place inside a temple. The exhibition potential of an easel painting is greater than that of mosaics or frescoes that preceded it. And while the exhibition potential of a mass may originally have been no less than that of a symphony, the symphony emerged at a time when its exhibition potential promised to surpass that of the mass.

With the various methods of technical reproduction, the exhibition potential of artworks has grown to such an extent that the quantitative shift between its two poles—cult value and exhibition value—has resulted in a qualitative transformation in its nature, much like in primeval times. Just as in primeval times the absolute emphasis on cult value turned the artwork primarily into an instrument of magic—something only later recognized as an artwork—today, the absolute emphasis on exhibition value transforms the artwork into a creation with entirely new functions. Among these functions, the one we consciously recognize—the artistic function—stands out as one that may later be seen as incidental.[^3]

What is certain is that photography and, further, film provide the most useful tools for understanding this transformation.


[^1]:This polarity is prevented from receiving due attention in the aesthetics of Idealism, which conceptually admits beauty only as something undivided (so excludes it as being divided). Nevertheless, in Hegel it makes its presence felt as clearly as can be imagined within the bounds of Idealism. ‘Images,’ we read in the *Lectures on the Philosophy of History*, ‘had been around for a long time: piety required them early on for its devotions, but the images did not need to be *beautiful* ones; indeed, piety found these actually disturbing. In the beautiful image there is also something external present, yet in so far as this is beautiful its spirit speaks to mankind; however, a key element in those devotions is the relationship to a *thing*, since they are themselves merely an unspiritual numbing of the mind $$ … $$. Beautiful art $$ … $$ arose in the Church itself $$ … $$ even though $$ … $$ art had already stepped outside the *principe* of the Church.’ A passage in the *Lectures on Aesthetics* also indicates that Hegel was aware of a problem here. As we read in these *Lectures*: ‘$$ … $$ We are beyond being able to venerate works of art as divine, offering them our worship; the impression they make is of a more considered kind, and what they arouse in us requires a higher touchstone.’

[^2]:The transition from the first type of artistic reception to the second determines the historical course of artistic reception generally. Nevertheless, a certain oscillation between the two poles of reception can in principle be demonstrated for each individual work of art. Take the Sistine *Madonna*, for instance. Since Hubert Grimme’s study we have known that the Sistine *Madonna* was originally painted for display purposes. Grimme was prompted to undertake his research by the question: what is the point of the wooden shelf in the foreground of the painting on which the two *putti* are leaning? How (Grimme went on to ask) did an artist like Raphael come to furnish heaven with a pair of portières? Investigation revealed that the Sistine *Madonna* had been commissioned on the occasion of the public lying-in-state of Pope Sixtus. Popes lay in state in a particular side chapel of St Peter’s. At the rear of this chapel, which was shaped like a niche, Raphael’s painting rested on the coffin during the lying-in-state ceremony. What Raphael shows in the painting is the Madonna emerging from the niche framed by the two green portière curtains and approaching the pope’s coffin, walking on clouds. At the memorial service for Sixtus, this outstanding display value of Raphael’s painting came into its own. Some time later the painting was mounted on the high altar of the abbey church of the Black Monks in Piacenza. The reason for this exile lies in Roman ritual. Roman ritual forbids images that have been used for lying-in-state ceremonies to be used for worship at the high altar. Raphael’s work was to some extent devalued by this provision. To get a proper price for it all the same, the Curia decided to include in the sale its tacit permission to use the painting on the high altar. And to avoid a row, it was arranged that the painting should go to a monastic brotherhood in a remote provincial town.

[^3]: Similar considerations, but at a different level, are raised by Brecht: ‘If the term “work of art” is no longer suitable for the thing that emerges when a work of art becomes a commodity, we must carefully and discreetly (yet without trepidation) drop the term if we do not wish simultaneously to abolish the function of that commodity, because this is a phase it must go through, and I mean that quite literally, this is no casual deviation from the correct path, what happens to it here is going to change it profoundly, eradicating its past to an extent that, were the old term to be resumed (and it will be, why not?), it will have ceased to evoke any reminder of what it once described.’
