The debate that was fought out in the 19th century between painting and photography over the artistic value of their products seems misguided and confused today. However, this does not diminish its significance; it may, in fact, underscore it. Indeed, this debate was an expression of a far-reaching historical upheaval, the nature of which neither party was aware. As the age of technical reproducibility severed art from its cultic foundation, the illusion of its autonomy vanished forever. However, the functional transformation of art that accompanied this change escaped the notice of the 19th century—and even the 20th century, which witnessed the development of film, failed to recognize it for a long time.

*Previously, much futile ingenuity had been devoted to deciding whether photography was an art—without first addressing the preliminary question of whether the invention of photography had altered the overall character of art.* Film theorists soon adopted a similarly premature line of questioning. Yet the challenges photography posed to traditional aesthetics were child’s play compared to those that film would introduce. Hence the blind forcefulness that characterizes early film theory. For example, Abel Gance compares film to hieroglyphs: “Thus we find ourselves, due to a most curious return to what has been, once again on the level of expression used by the Egyptians… The language of images has not yet matured because our eyes are not yet attuned to it. There is still not enough respect, not enough reverence for what is expressed through it.”[^1] Similarly, Séverin Mars writes: “What other art has been granted a dream that is… both more poetic and more real at the same time? From such a perspective, film would represent an utterly incomparable means of expression, and only persons of the noblest mindset should move within its atmosphere in the most perfect and mysterious moments of their lives.”[^2] Alexandre Arnoux concludes a fantasy about silent film with this question: “Should not all these daring descriptions we have employed ultimately lead to a definition of prayer?”[^3]
It is highly instructive to observe how these theorists’ efforts to classify film as “art” compel them to interpret cultic elements into it with unparalleled recklessness. And yet, at the time these speculations were published, works like L’Opinion publique (A Woman of Paris) and La ruée vers l’or (The Gold Rush) already existed. This did not prevent Abel Gance from drawing comparisons with hieroglyphs or Séverin Mars from speaking about film as one might speak about paintings by Fra Angelico. It is telling that even today particularly reactionary authors seek to define film’s significance in similar terms—if not explicitly in sacred terms, then at least in supernatural ones. On the occasion of Reinhardt’s film adaptation of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Werfel observed that it was undoubtedly the sterile imitation of external reality—with its streets, interiors, train stations, restaurants, cars, and beaches—that had so far hindered film’s ascent into the realm of art. “Film has not yet grasped its true meaning or its real possibilities… These lie in its unique ability to express the magical, wondrous, and supernatural with natural means and unparalleled conviction.”[^4]
