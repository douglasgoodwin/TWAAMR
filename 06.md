*In photography, exhibition value begins to push back cult value across the board.* However, cult value does not retreat without resistance. It takes up a final stronghold, and that is the human face. It is no coincidence that portraiture stands at the center of early photography. In the cult of remembrance for distant or deceased loved ones, the cult value of the image finds its last refuge. In the fleeting expression of a human face, the aura flickers for the last time in early photographs. This is what constitutes their melancholic and incomparable beauty. But where humans withdraw from photography, exhibition value first emerges as superior to cult value. The unparalleled significance of Atget lies in having given this process its space; he captured the streets of Paris around 1900 in aspects devoid of people. It has been rightly said of him that he photographed them like crime scenes. A crime scene, too, is devoid of people. Its recording occurs for the sake of evidence.

With Atget, photographic images begin to become evidence in a historical trial. This constitutes their hidden political significance. They already demand a specific kind of reception. Detached contemplation is no longer appropriate for them. They unsettle the viewer; he feels compelled to seek a particular approach to them. Illustrated magazines simultaneously begin to provide him with signpostsâ€”whether correct or incorrect matters little. In these magazines, captions first became obligatory. And it is clear that these captions have an entirely different character than the title of a painting.
The directives that viewers receive from captions in illustrated magazines soon become even more precise and authoritative in film, where the interpretation of each individual image seems dictated by the sequence of all preceding ones.
