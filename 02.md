### II

Even in the most perfect reproduction, one thing is missing: the here and now of the artwork—its unique existence at the place where it happens to be. It is this unique existence, and nothing else, that bears the history to which the artwork has been subject over the course of its existence. This includes both the changes it has undergone in its physical structure over time and the changing ownerships it may have entered into.[^1] The traces of the former can only be uncovered through chemical or physical analyses, which cannot be performed on reproductions; the traces of the latter are a matter of tradition, which must be pursued from the location of the original.

The “here and now” of the original defines its authenticity. Chemical analyses of a bronze’s patina, for example, can help establish its authenticity; similarly, proving that a specific medieval manuscript originates from a 15th-century archive can aid in determining its authenticity. *The entire realm of authenticity eludes reproduction—technical reproduction and, naturally, not just technical reproduction.*[^2] While authenticity retained its full authority in relation to manual reproduction (which was typically dismissed as forgery), this is no longer the case with technical reproduction. The reason is twofold. First, technical reproduction is more independent of the original than manual reproduction. For example, photography can highlight aspects of the original that are accessible only to an adjustable lens choosing its viewpoint arbitrarily but not to the human eye. It can also use certain techniques, such as magnification or slow motion, to capture images that are entirely beyond natural optics. That is the first point.

Second, technical reproduction can place the copy of the original in situations inaccessible to the original itself. Above all, it allows it to meet the viewer halfway—whether in the form of a photograph or a phonograph record. The cathedral leaves its location to be encountered in an art lover’s studio; a choral work performed in a hall or under open skies can now be heard in a room.

The circumstances into which technical reproduction introduces an artwork may leave its physical existence untouched—but they invariably diminish its “here and now.” While this applies not only to artworks but also, for instance, to landscapes that pass before viewers in film, this process affects a core aspect of art more deeply than it does anything natural: its authenticity. The authenticity of a thing encompasses everything about it that has been handed down from its origin—its material permanence as well as its historical testimony. Since historical testimony is founded on material permanence, when permanence is lost in reproduction, so too is testimony: the historical testimony of the thing begins to waver. It is precisely this testimony—and with it, the authority of the object—that falters.[^3]

What disappears here can be summarized under the concept of aura: what withers in the age of technical reproducibility is the aura of the artwork. This process is symptomatic; its significance extends beyond art itself. In general terms, one could say that reproduction technology detaches what is reproduced from the realm of tradition. By multiplying reproductions, it replaces their unique existence with their mass existence. And by allowing reproductions to meet viewers in their particular situations, it actualizes what is reproduced. These two processes lead to a profound upheaval in what has been handed down—a disruption of tradition that mirrors humanity’s current crisis and renewal. They are closely connected with today’s mass movements. Their most powerful agent is film.
The social significance of film—even in its most positive manifestations—is inseparable from this destructive and cathartic aspect: the liquidation of tradition’s value within cultural heritage. This phenomenon is most tangible in major historical films. It continues to expand into new domains. When Abel Gance enthusiastically proclaimed in 1927: “Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Beethoven will make films… All legends, all mythologies and myths, all founders of religions—even all religions—await their illuminated resurrection; heroes crowd at their gates,” he was unwittingly inviting comprehensive liquidation.


[^1]: It goes without saying that the history of the work of art embraces more: that of the *Mona Lisa*, for instance, includes the nature and number of the copies made of it in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries.

[^2]:Precisely because genuineness is not reproducible, intensive intrusion by certain reproductive processes (technological ones) provided a handle for differentiating and grading genuineness. Cultivating such distinctions was an important function of the art trade. This had an obvious interest in maintaining a separation between different prints from a wood block (those prior to and those subsequent to printing), a copperplate, and the like. With the invention of wood engraving, the quality of genuineness was attacked at the root, so to speak, before it had produced its late flowering. ‘Genuine’ was something a medieval Madonna image was not at the time of its making – not yet; that was something it became over the course of ensuing centuries, most plentifully, perhaps, in the last [the nineteenth century].

[^3]:The crummiest provincial performance of *Faust* nevertheless has this over a *Faust* film: notionally, it stands in competition with the first Weimar performance. And what, in terms of traditional content, the audience may recall across the footlights becomes unusable in the cinema (e.g. the fact that the character of Mephisto contains elements of a friend of Goethe’s youth, Johann Heinrich Merck, and so on and so forth).
