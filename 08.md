### VIII

The artistic performance of a stage actor is definitively presented to the audience by the actor themselves in person; in contrast, the artistic performance of a film actor is presented to the audience through an apparatus. This has two consequences. First, the apparatus that brings the film actor’s performance to the audience is not obligated to respect this performance as a totality. Under the direction of the cameraman, it continually takes a position on this performance. The sequence of positions that the editor composes from the material delivered to them forms the finished film. It consists of a certain number of moments of movement that must be recognized as such by the camera—not to mention special shots such as close-ups. In this way, the actor’s performance is subjected to a series of optical tests. This is the first consequence of the fact that the film actor’s performance is presented through an apparatus.
The second consequence arises from the fact that, since the film actor does not present their performance directly to the audience, they lose the ability—reserved for stage actors—to adjust their performance to the audience during its presentation. As a result, the audience assumes the position of an evaluator who is not disrupted by any personal contact with the actor. *The audience empathizes with the actor only by empathizing with the apparatus. It adopts the apparatus’s perspective: it tests.*[^1] This is not a perspective to which cult values can be subjected.

[^1]: The film … provides (or could provide) usable insights into human actions in detail… Any motivation stemming from character is omitted; the inner life of the characters is never the main cause and is rarely the primary result of the action.” (Brecht, 1. c. (p. 484), p. 268.) The expansion of the field of what can be tested, which the apparatus achieves with the film actor, corresponds to the extraordinary expansion of the field of what can be tested that has arisen for individuals due to economic circumstances. Thus, the importance of aptitude tests for professions continues to grow. In professional aptitude tests, it is about excerpts from an individual’s performance. Film recordings and professional aptitude tests take place before a panel of experts. The director in the film studio occupies exactly the same position as the examiner in an aptitude test.
