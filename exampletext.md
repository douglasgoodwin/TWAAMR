## Unpacking My Library
#### Walter Benjamin

I’m in the middle of that most chaotic yet thrilling of tasks: unpacking my library. If you picture uniform shelves or neat rows, think again—the books are still strewn around in open crates, dust particles draping the air like confetti, and scraps of paper littering the floor. It’s a scene of glorious disorder—one I’m inviting you into because it perfectly reflects the mindset of a die-hard collector. Think of it as an unboxing video gone rogue. The volumes have been confined to darkness for two long years, and now they’re finally emerging into the light, ready to be appreciated for far more than just their content. This is about the personal flavor and attachments that pepper a collector’s world—how and why we acquire, maintain, and obsess over the things we love.

Let’s be straight: I won’t be cataloging the bestsellers or prizewinners on my shelves. That might be “useful,” but it misses the point. The real intrigue is in that spark between a collector and his collection—the stories, the serendipities, the crated chaos that eventually masquerades as order. Every serious collector knows the feeling: losing a treasured volume can feel like losing a piece of your identity, and you’ll stop at nothing to get a sought-after title, sometimes skirting the edges of legality (or at least decency) along the way. There’s a reason Anatole France once quipped that the only truly precise knowledge is knowing a book’s release date and its format. Because in a collection, confusion is always just one mislabeled volume away.

So consider the collector’s universe a delicate balance of chaos and order. It’s a running theme—piles of books waiting to be tamed, infinite Pinterest-perfect organization tips that never quite come to fruition. The collector is also beholden to a weird kind of relationship with ownership. Sure, folks talk about “utilitarian value” (does the object do anything?), but that’s not on our radar. We see these volumes more like mini time machines, each stowing away a unique fate, waiting to connect with us at just the right moment. Handling a pristine first edition—or even a tattered second printing that belonged to someone famous—can feel downright mystical. In that instant, you sense the entire story of how the book came to be, who owned it, where it was read, all twirling around in your mind like some real-life version of VR goggles.

There’s a centuries-old Latin phrase, “Habent sua fata libelli”—books have their own destinies. And sure, that might apply to classics like The Divine Comedy or The Origin of Species, but a real collector goes even deeper—every individual copy of each book has its own special destiny. The moment it meets the collector is basically a second birth. It’s a bit childlike, blended with the gravity of age and experience. That’s the real allure of collecting older volumes too, because for every new arrival on your shelf, there’s this sense you’re reviving some part of the past, breathing fresh life into paper that’s already turned golden with time.

Yet how thoroughly times have changed, and how yesterday’s methods of finding books have spawned new approaches in the digital era. Now we have e-commerce juggernauts, web-based auctions, and global shipping that can land a first edition on your doorstep by next Tuesday. Classic print catalogs remain, of course, but in parallel, search engines and apps trawl the world’s inventories in seconds. And while heading into dusty brick-and-mortar shops still brings its own charms, you can replicate that thrill at your desk at 3 a.m., haggling in a global online auction. Surprise is never gone, either: even a cardboard package that arrives via drab mail service has its own unboxing drama—the second you spot a rare publication date, a scribbled inscription, or an unusual binding, that same jolt of discovery fires up. We might trade crates for delivery boxes and in-person hunts for URL scrambles, but the magic’s still there, bridging memory, fate, and an unshakable sense of wonder.

There are a thousand ways to acquire books, of course. Some say the “most praiseworthy” is to write them yourself. Jean Paul’s fictional schoolteacher Wutz famously compiled an entire library by just penning titles he couldn’t afford—extreme, but it shows that real writing might be an act of reimagining books that don’t exist in a form you appreciate. For the typical collector, there’s also that infamous method of borrowing a book and then conveniently forgetting to return it. Ask any longtime collector, and you’ll sense a pattern: often, the bigger sin is letting it languish unread. There’s a kernel of ancient wisdom here—real collectors sometimes prize owning a book more (and differently) than reading it. Anatole France, again, nails it: “I don’t suppose you eat off your best china every day?”

Back in my earlier, more militant collecting days, I only allowed books I had not yet read to join my shelves—an odd personal rule that might have kept my library forever tiny. Then inflation hit, and books got harder to find and more expensive. Suddenly, with each fresh order, I was rescuing small cultural treasures from almost certain oblivion. That’s how a collector’s mentality goes: the adrenaline rush of securing a book that might be impossible to get tomorrow.

Now, you might think once we get past these anecdotal detours, there’s a “normal” route to purchasing books. But no, that’s not the collector’s way. Traveling, for instance, can be like a strategic campaign: the nearest secondhand shop might be a fortress, the dusty corner store a secret goldmine. And of course, a good old-fashioned catalog—physical or digital—can either break your heart or bring euphoria, depending on what arrives. Each volume is like a lottery ticket: the condition might be a letdown, or it might exceed every expectation.

Even auctions, whether in-person or online, come with their own psychological warfare. You don’t just bid on a book; you track who else is bidding, what your budget can handle, and whether you really need to brag over that final hammer price. A crafty collector also knows there’s joy in rescue: snagging some neglected volume because no one else recognized its potential. Imagine a story right out of The Thousand and One Nights—plucking that mesmerizing old edition from the marketplace, granting it freedom on your shelf.

I can still recall the electrifying moment I got my hands on Balzac’s La Peau de chagrin in 1915. There I was, a broke student, sneaking into the game where seasoned collectors dropped serious cash. My heart nearly burst when the gavel banged in my favor. What happened the next morning at the pawnshop to make ends meet—maybe let’s not delve into that. Another time, I pulled the ultimate stealth move: in a bidding war, I realized my every bid triggered a competitor’s. So, I never bid on the one I truly wanted, and after the auction, I grabbed that gem at the secondhand counter for a bargain. Score one for cunning collectors everywhere.

Fast-forward to the present: I’m working my way through a jungle of crates, pulling out volumes that haven’t had fresh air for years. It’s so addictive I can’t stop. That moment you gently lift a rare pamphlet or a dog-eared children’s book your mother once glued pictures into—these are the emotional rewards, the memory triggers. Every living library, no matter how meticulously curated, has those borderline items. Maybe they’re family scrapbooks, random pamphlets, or battered issues of a ‘zine that you can’t bear to throw away. Inheritance, too, can spark an entire new wave of collecting. There’s a respect for the fact that these physical objects outlast us, and in their best state, we pass them on to another generation of rummagers and dreamers.

A cynic might call this pastime archaic, suspect, or even pointless in a digital world. But the collector’s passion isn’t just about the object at hand; it’s also about the entire framework of personal meaning—and yes, mania—that grows up around it. Even public archives, for all their social benefits, might lack that personal spark. And time is marching forward, possibly leaving this quirky breed behind. Yet, as Hegel said, the owl of Minerva only takes flight at dusk—meaning we truly understand a phenomenon just when it’s fading out. So maybe this brand of collector is headed for the twilight years, but that only makes us more aware of the timeless, almost otherworldly glow that comes from rummaging through crates and forging an intimate connection with each individual volume.

Right now, it’s after midnight, and there’s just one half-emptied box left. I’m restless, carried along by a rush of recollections—cities visited, antique shops conquered, midnight auctions waged. I picture the houses and apartments where these books used to live, the times they were read or merely displayed. I recall my tiny dorm in Munich, the quiet Swiss village on Lake Brienz, my childhood bedroom where I first lined up a mere handful of spines. And I feel, once again, that deep, private bliss in how each book’s fate is entangled with my own.

Does the collector bring these books to life? Or is it they who give him new life? Maybe both. At any rate, I’ll disappear back into the stacks now, letting the books become my walls, so I can inhabit them as thoroughly as they inhabit me. That, in a nutshell, is the collector’s way—a relationship more personal, complex, and quietly electric than any bookshelf cameo can express.
