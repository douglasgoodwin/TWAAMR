## Unpacking My Library
#### Walter Benjamin

I am here on the floor, surrounded by wooden crates and open boxes—the strange minutiae of relocating old possessions in a new space. Bits of packing paper, fine flecks of dust, and that unmistakable whiff of cardboard cling to the air, stirring a sense of subdued excitement. I think about these books, how they’ve been sequestered for years, how they’ve endured darkness in a way that is both literal and metaphorical. You see them now in piles at my feet, unmoored and without structure. Tomorrow, or maybe the next day, I’ll line them up on familiar shelves, but for now they remain precarious, suspended between original intent and future order.

I suppose I should clarify that this essay—this exercise in confronting the aftermath of crated books—does not exist to parade my library’s star attractions. Which edition of this classic do I own, or when did I acquire that rare children’s treasury? Such disclosures might reinforce some aura of competence, but they betray the point. Instead, I’d like to draw you in, show you what actually transpires in the mind of a collector, one who stands amid stacks of volumes that have not seen light for two entire years. You picture me blowing off dust, pausing to squint at a once-familiar title tag, reuniting with it after a long estrangement. This is the reality: the gesture is about much more than the books themselves. It is, in some deep sense, personal.

Collectors traffic in a different kind of enchantment, caught between a craving for deliberate order and the inevitable mess their obsession creates. The neat allotment of volumes on a shelf can, for an onlooker, appear laudably precise, and yet internally it feels like nothing but a fragile truce. There are stories of people who lost their books to misfortune and never quite recovered from the blow. Others, in pursuit of a single fabled copy, propelled themselves toward small acts of moral compromise. This may all sound dramatic, but in my experience, it only underscores a single truth: no kind of homing or sorting can mask that, for a collector, every “organized” arrangement hovers above a great abyss, easily undone.

Even so, the collector’s life is not defined solely by chaos; it’s also a persistent dance with the idea of order. There is something about walking a thin line between the random and the arranged—something that seems to unlock a secret infatuation with the objects themselves. Books, to the collector, are neither strictly ornamental nor solely utilitarian. They carry a past, a presence, what a friend of mine called “the hush of provenance.” They can spin entire genealogies of past owners and ephemeral enchantments, all of which seem to crystallize at the moment you cradle some treasured volume in your hand.

We can say, or repeat, that old phrase: “Habent sua fata libelli”—books have their destinies. We know this about the well-known towers of literature: Dante, Spinoza, Darwin. But the real heft, the real flutter of excitement, rests with how each single copy crosses into a given person’s life. You might hold a battered novel from an obscure press, the text itself widely available, but your edition came from a certain bookstore on a certain street in a certain year. Maybe the year everything changed. Maybe the year you needed it most. It’s a small resurrection, a bridging of your personal timeline with the object’s own twisted route across continents and owners. This is the collector’s real impetus: a private act of renewal.

Times shift, of course, and we accumulate these books in any number of ways: by losing track of them in locked storerooms, by scribbling a friend’s borrowed volume into indefinite captivity, or by determinedly cultivating tomes we’ll never read. Such habits would baffle the purely logical mind—“Shouldn’t all books be read?” But the collector senses something else at play. It’s not always about absorbing the text. It can be about the unspoken drama of possessing it, pulling it close, placing it on a quiet shelf.

For me, early on, the rule was simple: I refused to purchase anything I had already read. I wanted the thrill of discovering the unknown. I believed that if I enforced this principle, my library would grow in a way that reflected a younger, more militant version of myself. But that innocence gave way amid shifting economic winds and sudden scarcity. Books that once were easy to find became nearly unattainable—so I hoarded what I could. In hindsight, it feels like a rescue mission: each item pried from the jaws of inflation or the ravages of the secondhand market.

People assume that acquiring books is a straightforward affair, that it’s little more than a chore we perform at a local shop, or a gift we wrap for someone’s birthday. Yet for the ardent collector, each acquisition can pose an intricate puzzle. Travel, catalogs, sudden auctions, secret parental legacies—these become your supply lines. You craft strategies, scout out old shops in battered districts of foreign cities, or devour a dog-eared catalog that no one else reads anymore. Sometimes, of course, you take a gamble: you bid on a volume you haven’t touched, praying that it arrives with minimal water damage, or with that original illustration intact. Sometimes you’re pleasantly surprised. Sometimes fate turns you into a regretful caretaker with an overdrawn bank account and a worthless edition.

But consider the unwavering thrill of rescue. Spotting a volume, battered and unloved, languishing on a dusty table where no one else glances. In that moment, the collector becomes a kind of benevolent conspirator, saving an object from obscurity. On my shelves, I can trace entire rows of these tiny redemption stories, each with its own cameo of memory. Perhaps it’s a book I snatched at an auction because a high-rolling bidder lost focus, or one I found in a mislabeled bin at a Sunday flea market. The narrative that led to my possession is as essential as the title itself—sometimes more so.

One especially dramatic moment came when I acquired a particular Balzac—La Peau de chagrin—during a high-tension auction in 1915. The whole affair unfolded in a swirl of inattentiveness and large sums tossed casually around by wealthier bidders. It was not so much about the money, though it might have seemed that way, but about the magnitude of desire, the flutter in my chest as I lifted my auction card. And then there’s its contrary experience, when I willed myself to keep silent as the item I coveted nearly slipped out of everyone’s mind, so I could claim it quietly afterward. These are not just stories of acquisition; they’re small meditations on risk and timing, on the caprice of a moment.

It’s now well past midnight. My body aches from leaning over crates, scanning and sorting, my fingertips ghosted by old dust. I think how easily I could stop this right now—stack the books in rough piles, call it a night. But I don’t, because each retrieval is another chance to recall the city in which I found a certain book, the year and place I first read it, the way my mother might have clipped pictures into an album that I only inherited decades later. Collecting becomes a topography of memory. When you see my shelves, you’re not just seeing an assemblage of texts—you’re peering into a map of personal history, each title and worn spine acting like pushpins that anchor my recollections of Naples, Munich, or a silent Swiss refuge.

Nothing about this is strictly practical. Yes, I might consult a rarer edition for a line of text, or reference some out-of-print treatise. But mostly, I keep these books because they sustain a dimension of myself. Public libraries (and I do admire them) serve the many; a private library, perversely, caters to the one. In so doing, it reveals that behind the mania, behind the lust for that final missing gem, lies a simple truth: I know these books, and they know me.

At last, I fill the final spot on the floor with another crate, only half-empty, an exercise that feels more symbolic than practical. It’s dangerously late, and I catch a flash of images from those cities I’ve known, from the murmured rummaging of little shops I once frequented, from the first shelves I put up as a student. Maybe all collecting is part nostalgia, part promise—a hovering in the space between what once was and what might yet be. It occurs to me how precarious it all is, how ephemeral, and yet how much it shapes me. Collectors inhabit the objects they value, breathe life into them. And here in the gloom, kneeling among my crates, I realize I am about to vanish into these shelves—about to let them form a second skin, a quiet mosaic of stories that keep me wholly, and sometimes precariously, alive.
