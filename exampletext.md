## Unpacking My Library
#### Walter Benjamin

I find myself amid an oddly exhilarating confusion: crates of books newly wrested from their cardboard prisons, wood dust hanging thick in the air, scraps of paper scattered at my feet. These crates, pried open after two long years, stand as a testament to the peculiar ardor of collecting—an enthusiasm, I might add, that runs deeper than the usual love of reading or the convenience of a reference shelf. Consider this a meditation on the collector’s mind, in which books transcend their text and become vessels of personal reveries. Here, in this dimly lit room, titled volumes mingle with battered pamphlets, and the days of their captivity linger like an echo against the promise of eventual order. In truth, I care less about the shelves they’ll occupy than the chaotic interim that reveals what collecting genuinely entails.

To a certain perspective, it appears I’m simply reorganizing old possessions. But step closer, and you’ll sense that this entire scene—dust, disheveled books, and an irrepressible sense of anticipation—is an invitation into the psyche of a true collector. It asks that we suspend the assumption that all books exist for reading. In this trance-like intermezzo between open crate and well-ordered library, there is a flicker of deeper recognition: we love objects not merely for their function but also for the stories, accrued histories, and faint ghosts of past owners they carry with them.

This interplay of chaos and order forms the crux of a collector’s life. Even the slightest nudge of disruption—a missing volume, a mislabeled edition—can spiral into hours of rummaging, reorganizing, and rethinking, until chaos once again resolves into carefully curated structure. Nor should we downplay the complicated sense of “ownership” at play. The collector feels a near-ancestral duty toward each acquisition. Practical use, whether for research or reading, sometimes fades into irrelevance. Instead, each book serves as a kind of microcosm, harboring experiences and legacies that the collector fervently pieces together like a puzzle. As Anatole France once remarked, “The only exact knowledge there is, is the knowledge of the date of publication and the format of books,” a declaration that underscores the delicate interplay between precision and disarray.

Books, after all, have fates—some renowned, others secret. Take Dante’s Divine Comedy or Darwin’s Origin of Species, which have long been recognized for their formidable legacy. But from a collector’s vantage, each individual copy, each printing and marginal doodle, carries its own particular destiny. The moment one of these preloved volumes crosses the threshold of a private collection is its small but certain rebirth. This phenomenon reveals the childlike wonder that underpins collecting: to resurrect the past, to find delight in the tangibility of older worlds, and, in so doing, to merge the old with the new.

Yet how thoroughly the tides of acquisition have shifted. Where once we trawled through physical catalogs, rummaged in quaint antiquarian bookshops, or placed anxious bids at in-person auctions, we now live in an era of digital marketplaces, global shipping, and online bidding wars that unfold across multiple time zones. Catalogs still arrive in the mail, of course, and the allure of a dusty bookstore remains irrepressible. Yet the fluid, instantaneous nature of e-commerce coexists alongside those traditional methods, weaving a tapestry in which an 18th-century pamphlet might, with a few clicks, find its way to our doorstep in mere days. If anything, such immediacy only heightens the surprise: even in the tidy packaging of an online purchase, one detects that familiar jolt of excitement. A missing dust jacket, an inscription on the flyleaf, or an unexpected note from a previous owner can conjure the old magic as surely as stumbling upon a rare folio in the back room of a centuries-old shop.

As I survey the boxes, I recall what Jean Paul’s little schoolmaster Wutz once did—building an entire library by writing out copies of books he could never afford. That kind of dedication to the idea of owning texts borders on the mythic. By contrast, a more dubious tradition is the “borrowed book that’s never returned,” a route that has long fascinated certain collectors. Indeed, a collector’s true hallmark may be the ability to preserve a book’s presence on the shelf more than a dogged intent to read it. This might puzzle the uninitiated, but those drawn into this realm understand there’s a joy in stewardship that sometimes eclipses the content itself.

In my earliest years of collecting, I tried valiantly to read every new acquisition, a regime enforced by limited funds. Over time, however, circumstances—and occasional windfalls—allowed me to stockpile volumes I had not yet opened. There is a certain grandeur in that willingness to house, perhaps for years, a story you have not fully absorbed, knowing you will someday choose the perfect moment for its discovery.

The chase for rare books is no straightforward matter of money, either. Sometimes the real value lies in the thrill of pursuit: rummaging through the bins of a flea market, perusing a sale in an unfamiliar city, or placing a hopeful bid in an online auction. Witnessing the process can be as exhilarating as the final purchase. At auctions, whether physical or virtual, tension can spike when rival collectors fixate on the same prized item—a dramatic test of resolve, a dance of egos as well as budgets. Then again, some of the best finds emerge serendipitously, when a neglected volume goes unnoticed by all but one keen observer, and the rightful caretaker steps forward to “rescue” it. 

The memory of such moments lingers long afterward, joined by recollections of the spaces and people that facilitated the exchange—faded shops in Munich, basement nooks in Berlin, or secondhand listings from across an ocean. These recollections swirl about me now, as I break open the next box, rummaging at midnight in the glow of a single lamp. A fragile album of pasted illustrations from my mother’s childhood resurfaces, alignment askew. Every collector’s library, for all its attempts at order, inevitably accommodates these liminal objects—family keepsakes, ephemeral volumes gleaned from a sidewalk cart, old journals whose worth cannot be measured by market standards.

In that sense, the collector’s attentiveness to each item borders on the ancestral. A collector is an heir, not just to property but to tradition, to memory, to the intangible significance these items come to embody. Public collections might benefit the many, but only private collections can truly cradle the fierce emotional imprint left by each volume’s journey.

And so the night stretches on, me in a circle of half-emptied crates, remembering the storied pathways behind each acquisition. I recall cramped student lodgings where these books once lined the walls, or the solemn quiet of a Swiss lakeside retreat where I first fell deeply under their spell. I recall both the mania and serenity of this vocation, an act that might strike an outsider as futile or quaint in a data-driven age. In truth, the collector feels it more pointedly than anyone: time is marching forward, and our bond with these physical objects may eventually seem like a relic. Yet in that exact tension—the fleeting nature of an object’s existence paired with our devotion—there lies a singular joy. It manifests in small epiphanies: the instant you settle a volume into a spot that is purely its own, or the hush of remembrance when you run your hand across a worn spine, reconnected to a personal history you had momentarily set aside.

The collector coexists with the possessions that shape him, and it’s by vanishing into their collective presence that his role is finally fulfilled. The boxes that now surround me form a temporary labyrinth, each book a vantage point to a distinct memory. Soon, I’ll shelve them neatly, the crates and dust swept away. But let me enjoy this fleeting disarray, for it reveals how each treasured volume has, at one point or another, been lost, found, acquired, and cherished. In their pursuit, I have also found a part of myself. And so the collector steps inside this living architecture of objects, letting the books become his walls—an intimate, self-made universe woven from the stories each spine silently holds.
