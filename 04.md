### IV

The uniqueness of the artwork is identical with its embedding in the context of tradition. This tradition itself, however, is something entirely living, something extraordinarily changeable. An ancient statue of Venus, for example, was embedded in a different context of tradition among the Greeks, who made it an object of worship, than among the medieval clerics, who saw in it a pernicious idol. What confronted both in the same way, however, was its uniqueness—in other words, its aura. The original manner of embedding the artwork in the context of tradition found its expression in cult. As we know, the oldest works of art originated in the service of a ritual—first magical, then religious. It is now of decisive importance that this auratic mode of existence of the artwork never fully detached itself from its ritual function.[^1] In other words: The unique value of the “authentic” artwork is rooted in ritual, where it had its original and first use value. However mediated this may be, it remains recognizable even in the most profane forms of devotion to beauty as a secularized ritual.[^2] *The profane devotion to beauty that emerged with the Renaissance and remained valid for three centuries revealed its foundations clearly during its first major disruption.* When art began to sense the approach of a crisis—brought about by the emergence of photography as the first truly revolutionary means of reproduction (simultaneous with the advent of socialism)—it reacted with the doctrine of l’art pour l’art, which is a theology of art. From this arose a kind of negative theology in the form of the idea of “pure” art, which rejects not only any social function but also any determination by a concrete subject matter. (In literature, Mallarmé was the first to reach this standpoint.)

Understanding these connections is essential for considering works of art in the age of their technical reproducibility. For they prepare us for a decisive insight: The technical reproducibility of works of art emancipates them for the first time in history from their parasitic dependence on ritual. The reproduced artwork increasingly becomes the reproduction of an artwork designed for reproducibility.[^3] From a photographic plate, for example, multiple prints can be made; asking about an “authentic” print makes no sense. However, at the moment when authenticity ceases to be an applicable standard for artistic production, the entire social function of art undergoes a transformation. Its foundation in ritual is replaced by a new basis: its foundation in politics.


[^1]: The definition of aura as ‘a unique manifestation of a remoteness, no matter how near it may be’ represents nothing other than a formulation of the cultic value of the work of art in categories of spatial and temporal perception. Remoteness is the opposite of propinquity. The *essence* of remoteness is that it cannot be approached. Indeed, unapproachability is one of the chief qualities of the cultic image. By its very nature, it remains ‘remote no matter how near’. Any propinquity lent by its embodiment as matter does not impair the remoteness retained from its constituting a manifestation.

[^2]: The more the cultic value of the image is secularized, the less specific ideas of the substratum of its uniqueness become. To an ever-increasing extent, the uniqueness of the phenomenon inhabiting the cultic image is driven out by the empirical uniqueness of the artist or the artist’s creative achievement in the eye of the beholder. Never in its entirety, of course; the concept of genuineness never ceases to reach beyond that of authentic attribution. (This comes out with especial clarity in the person of the collector, who always has something of the slave to fetishism about him and through possessing the work of art partakes of its cultic power.) Nevertheless, the function of the concept of authenticity in the contemplation of art remains unambiguous: with the secularization of art, authenticity supplants cultic value.

[^3]: In connection with works of cinematography, the fact that the product can be reproduced by technological means is not (as with works of literature, for example, or painting) a condition of its mass circulation imposed from outside. *The technological reproducibility of films is rooted directly in the manner of their production. This not merely facilitates the mass circulation of films in the most direct way; it positively necessitates it*. It necessitates it because a film costs so much to produce that an individual who might be able to afford a painting, for instance, cannot afford the former. In 1927, someone worked out that a major film, if it was to pay for itself, had to reach an audience of nine million. With sound films, of course, things took a step backwards at first; the audience for ‘talkies’ was limited by language barriers, and this occurred at the same time as Fascism was laying such stress on national interests. However, more important than recording this setback (which in any case dubbing diminished) is considering its connection with Fascism. The fact that the two phenomena emerged at the same time has to do with the economic crisis. The same disturbances as, viewed on a grand scale, led to the attempt to preserve the existing conditions of ownership by means of open violence led the film capital threatened by the crisis to force the pace of preparations for the sound film. The introduction of sound films then, for a time, brought an easing of the situation. There were two reasons for this: sound films brought the masses back to the cinema, and they also created a fresh solidarity between new capital from the electrical industry and film capital. Looked at from outside, therefore, the sound film promoted national interests; but looked at from within it made film production even more international than before.
