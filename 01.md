The artwork has fundamentally always been reproducible. What humans have made, could always be replicated by other humans. Such replication was practiced by students for artistic practice, by masters to disseminate their works, and finally by profit-seeking third parties. In contrast, the technical reproduction of artworks is something new, which has emerged intermittently throughout history in widely spaced surges but with increasing intensity. The Greeks knew only two methods of technical reproduction of artworks: casting and stamping. Bronzes, terracottas, and coins were the only artworks they could produce en masse. All others were unique and technically irreproducible. With woodcut, graphic art became technically reproducible for the first time; it was so long before writing became reproducible through printing. The enormous changes that printing, the technical reproducibility of writing, brought to literature are well known. However, in the context of the phenomenon being considered here on a world-historical scale, they are only a particularly important special case. In addition to woodcut, copperplate engraving and etching emerged during the Middle Ages, and lithography at the beginning of the nineteenth century.
With lithography, reproduction technology reached a fundamentally new stage. The much more concise process, which distinguishes the application of a drawing onto a stone from its carving into a wooden block or etching onto a copper plate, gave graphic art the ability to bring its products to market not only en masse (as before) but also in new forms every day. Graphic art, through lithography, became capable of accompanying everyday life illustratively. It began to keep pace with printing. However, within a few decades of the invention of lithography, it was surpassed by photography. With photography, the hand was relieved for the first time from the most important artistic tasks in the process of pictorial reproduction, which now fell solely to the eye looking through the lens. Since the eye captures faster than the hand can draw, the process of pictorial reproduction was accelerated enormously, allowing it to keep pace with speech. The film operator, cranking in the studio, captures images at the same speed as the actor speaks. If the illustrated newspaper was virtually hidden in lithography, then the sound film was hidden in photography. The technical reproduction of sound was tackled at the end of the last century. These converging efforts have made a situation foreseeable, which Paul Valéry characterized with the sentence: “Just as water, gas, and electricity are brought into our homes from far away to serve us with almost no effort on our part, so we shall be supplied with visual or auditory images, which will appear and disappear at a simple movement of the hand, almost like a sign.”[^1]
*By around 1900, technical reproduction had reached a standard where it not only began to make the totality of traditional artworks its object and subject their effects to profound changes, but also secured its own place among the artistic methods.* For the study of this standard, nothing is more revealing than how its two different manifestations—the reproduction of artworks and film art—react back on art in its traditional form.
