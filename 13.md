The distinguishing features of film lie not only in the way in which man presents himself to the camera but in how, using the camera, he presents his surroundings to himself. A glance at performance psychology will illustrate the camera’s ability to test. A glance at psychoanalysis will illustrate a different aspect of that ability. Film has indeed enriched our perceptual world with methods that can be illustrated by those of Freudian theory. Fifty years ago, a conversational slip went more or less unnoticed. Its suddenly revealing depths in what had previously seemed a superficial discussion was probably regarded as an exception. Since *The Psychopathology of Everyday Life* [1901], that has changed. The book isolated and at the same time made susceptible of analysis things that had once swept past unnoticed in the broad stream of things perceived. Film has resulted in a similar deepening of apperception across the whole optical (and now also acoustic) segment of the sensory world. It is simply the reverse side of this state of affairs that performances presented in film can be analyzed more exactly and from many more angles than can performances expressed in paint or onstage. Compared with painting, it is the infinitely more detailed presentation of the situation that gives the performance portrayed on the screen its greater analysability. Compared with live theatre, the greater analysability of the performance portrayed cinematically is due to a higher degree of isolatability. That fact (and this is its chief significance) tends to foster the interpenetration of art and science. Indeed, in connection with a piece of behavior embedded in a specific situation and now (like a muscle from a cadaver) neatly dissected out, it can scarcely be said which is more gripping: its artistic worth or its scientific usefulness.

> This interpenetration of art and science has intensified in the age of computational vision. Like the anatomist's scalpel that reveals the hidden structures of life, algorithmic cameras now dissect light, time, and movement itself. What appears as a simple photograph is now the product of countless mathematical operations, each frame a synthesis of multiple exposures, every image simultaneously an artistic expression and a scientific analysis. The video essay emerges as a new form of knowledge, where critical analysis and creative expression become inseparable, much as Benjamin observed in early film's merger of scientific record and artistic performance.

*It will count among the revolutionary functions of film that it renders the artistic and scientific uses of photography, which beforehand generally diverged, recognizably identical*.[^17]

By choosing close-ups from stock, accentuating hidden details of props with which we are familiar, exploring commonplace environments under the inspired guidance of the lens, on the one hand film increases our understanding of the inevitabilities that govern our lives while ensuring, on the other hand, that we have a vast, undreamt-of amount of room for maneuver! Our pubs and city streets, our offices and furnished rooms, our factories and railway stations seemed desperately imprisoning. Then film came along and exploded all these dungeons with the dynamite of its tenths of a second, leaving us free, now, to undertake adventurous journeys amid their widely scattered ruins. The close-up expands space as the slow-motion sequence dilates movement. 

> Today's short-form video platforms have shattered not just the prison of perception but the very distinction between observer and observed. Each scroll reveals not the tenth of a second but the infinite fragmentation of experience itself. What Benjamin recognized in film's ability to isolate and analyze has become a constant stream of dissected moments, each one simultaneously intimate and public, personal and mass-produced. The bedroom becomes a stage, the bathroom a studio, every private space now a site of public performance. Here, the "optical unconscious" operates not through revelation but through endless reproduction - each gesture, sound, and image immediately becoming raw material for countless variations, each viewer simultaneously performer and audience.

> The aerial view, once the privilege of military reconnaissance and urban planners, has become part of our daily optical unconscious through drone photography. This new perspective reveals not just geometric patterns but power structures embedded in urban space, the invisible boundaries of class and control made visible from above. Yet this liberation of vision carries its own contradictions - the same technology that reveals also surveils, the freedom to see everything accompanied by the awareness of being perpetually observed. Benjamin's "room for maneuver" expands vertically while simultaneously being constrained by new forms of optical control.

And just as enlargement is not really concerned with simply clarifying what we glimpse ‘anyway’ but rather brings out wholly new structural formations in matter, neither does the slow-motion technique simply bring out familiar movement motifs but reveals in them others that are quite unfamiliar and that ‘bear no resemblance to decelerations of rapid movements but are like strangely gliding, floating, supernatural ones’. Palpably, then, this is a different nature that addresses the camera than the one that speaks to the eye. Different above all in that the space permeated by human consciousness is replaced by one that is unconsciously permeated. While it is quite normal for a person to draw conclusions, even if only in outline, from the way others walk, that person will certainly know nothing of the walkers’ posture in the split second of their stepping out. And if we have a rough idea of how we pick up a cigarette lighter or a spoon, we know little of what actually happens between hand and metal when we do so, not to mention how this will vary according to our current mood. Here the camera intervenes with its different aids, its plunging and soaring, its interrupting and isolating, its stretching and condensing of the process, its close-ups and its distance shots. Only the camera can show us the optical unconscious, as it is only through psychoanalysis that we learn of the compulsive unconscious.

> Modern portable cameras have democratized access to what Benjamin called the optical unconscious, but they've also transformed its nature. The slow-motion capture of a child's laugh or a falling drop of water reveals not just hidden movements but the manufactured nature of perception itself. Through augmented reality filters, the camera no longer simply reveals the unconscious but actively constructs it. Our self-image becomes a perpetual performance, tested and modified in real-time, the boundary between natural and artificial perception dissolving into a stream of algorithmic modifications. The optical unconscious is no longer simply revealed but continuously produced, each gesture simultaneously authentic and artificial, each moment both captured and created.

[^17]: If we are looking for an analogy with this situation, we shall find an instructive one in Renaissance painting. Here too we encounter an art whose unparalleled rise and importance rest not least on the fact that it includes within it a number of new sciences or at any rate fresh scientific data. It makes use of anatomy as well as perspective, mathematics, meteorology, and color theory. ‘What could be more remote for us,’ writes Valéry, ‘than the strange pretension of a Leonardo, for whom painting was a supreme goal and among the highest manifestations of wisdom – so much so, indeed, that in his convinced opinion it called for omniscience, and he himself did not shrink from a theoretical analysis before which men today stand in awe of its depth and detail.’
